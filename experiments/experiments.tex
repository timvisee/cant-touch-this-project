  \section{Preface}
  In this document, we will go through some experiments we've conducted for the
  platform we have built during the research minor KB-80. For each experiment
  we've written a new section describing what it is about, how we conduct the
  experiment and what our findings are. The general idea of conducing these
  experiments is to assert whether the current platform is \emph{usable} for
  the purpose we had originally in mind, namely controlling a generic computer.

  Although we've tested the platform quite thoroughly while building it, these
  experiments are conducted on the final version of the platform we've worked on
  with properly detected experiments and findings. With this we'll attempt to
  also answer some seemingly obvious thoughts.

  \paragraph{}
  The last part of the document goes over some ideas we came up with when
  working on on the project, and when conducting these experiments. These
  ideas may be implemented by others that continue the work on this project.

  \paragraph{}
  You may of course conduct similar experiments as we've described along with
  reading this document. Make sure you read the \emph{Manual} on how to install
  and use the product.

  \section{Accuracy \& Reliability}
  The accuracy and reliability of the gesture recognition is crucial to the
  succes of the platform. If it proves to be insufficient, then the platform is
  obsolete. No one will use it and time spent developing it will be wasted. If
  it is accurate and reliable however, then it may prove useful. It may be used
  to conduct research, and can be developed further.

  \subsection{Hard-coded gestures}
  To test our platform, we came up with a list of predefined gestures. These
  gestures are programmed/\emph{hard-coded} into the platform. This means that
  the predefined gesture is not jittery to begin with, as could be the case with
  recorded gestures. This list of gestures can be loaded into the program with
  the \emph{Load default templates} button in the bottom of the web interface.
  These gestures are quite simple and show well what is possible with the
  platform. For this first test, we attempted each gesture 40 times to measure
  it's detection rate. This, in a randomized order to prevent ourselves from
  using muscle memory.

  Here is the list of hard-coded gestures:
  \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist{}
    \item Straight line
    \item Circle clockwise
    \item Circle counter-clockwise
    \item Big circle clockwise
    \item Big circle counter-clockwise
    \item Triangle clockwise
    \item Triangle counter-clockwise
    \item Mini square clockwise
    \item Square clockwise
    \item Square counter-clockwise
  \end{itemize}

  When we tested these gestures ourselves, the results weren't so surprising
  after working with the system for many weeks. First of, detecting clockwise
  versus counter-clockwise gestures is not a problem at all. The platform works
  well for both, which is logical considering how the internals work.

  \paragraph{}
  The first few gestures work very well. In fact, all attempts for performing
  these worked and all got recognized correctly. The \emph{Straight line}
  gesture even got detected with a slight bent in the drawn line. Both circle
  variants are included too. These are easy and above all very quick to perform.
  We figured these could be cool for scrolling through a page.
  A light disadvantage of the line gestures is that because it is so simple, it
  did get matched against some false positives. When attempting to draw a large
  square the line gesture was detected twice.

  The triangle gestures were great as well, although we didn't got them right
  the first time. Out of the total 80 attempts for each of the two variants, 71
  got detected properly. Loosening the algorithm might even give us better
  results.

  The square gestures were slightly harder. The normal squares had 33 and 34
  correct hits. The small square had 25 hits. These squares have perfectly
  straight edges and corners. That might make it harder to perform correctly.
  What's interesting is that performing the small square was harder than the
  regular sized squares. Jitter in your finger and the sensor does have a larger
  effect on small figures, that might be what caused it.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |l|c|c|c| }
      \hline
      \textbf{Gesture} & \textbf{Attempts} &
      \textbf{Successes} & \textbf{Success \%} \\
      \hline
      Straight line & 40 & 40 & 100\% \\
      \hline
      Circle clockwise & 40 & 40 & 100\% \\
      \hline
      Circle counter-clockwise & 40 & 40 & 100\% \\
      \hline
      Big circle clockwise & 40 & 40 & 100\% \\
      \hline
      Big circle counter-clockwise & 40 & 40 & 100\% \\
      \hline
      Triangle clockwise & 40 & 35 & 87,5\% \\
      \hline
      Triangle counter-clockwise & 40 & 36 & 90\% \\
      \hline
      Mini square clockwise & 40 & 25 & 60,25\% \\
      \hline
      Square clockwise & 40 & 33 & 82,5\% \\
      \hline
      Square counter-clockwise & 40 & 34 & 85\% \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  \paragraph{}
  In general the detection for these shapes works surprisingly well to our
  opinion. The data shows that gestures with sharp corners are slightly harder
  to draw, probably because it's hard to actually perform a gesture with such
  sharpness above the sensor. Just to note, we also noticed that performing
  gestures with your non-dominant hand is slightly harder, although we don't
  have proper data to substantiate this.

  \subsection{Custom gestures}
  Because the system allows you to record your own gestures, and the hard-coded
  gestures might be a little too perfect, we decided to also manually record
  each gesture on the list to perform the same test afterwards.

  \paragraph{}
  Yet again, the line and circle gestures got recognized perfectly for each
  iteration even though the recordings might not have been perfect.

  There was one exception though, during the performance of one circle gesture
  the sensor (or our platform) seemed to get stuck for a little. This was shown
  in the visualizer. Only half of the circle was shown, and it continued with a
  straight line down. It was as if the circle was cut in half. Because the
  visualizer showed that the data was incorrect we decided to drop this erroneous
  iteration.

  \paragraph{}
  The triangle gesture worked a little better. Maybe this is because it was
  recorded manually it had rounded and less perfect corners making it easier to
  perform properly. Out of the 80 total attempts 74 got recognized correctly.

  The custom square gestures proved a similar result, although the result for
  the small squares was improved slightly from 25 correct attempts to 31.

  \subsection{Complex gestures}
  We also decided to attempt more complex gestures. With more complex we mean
  longer gestures and gestures with complex and sharp angles. We choose the
  following figures:

  \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist{}
    \item A $4\times1$ rectangle
    \item The number \verb_6_
    \item The letter \verb_W_
    \item A clockwise circle with a counter-clockwise circle after it
    \item The word \verb_hi_ in cursive font
  \end{itemize}

  The results are a little less great for these figures. First of all, the
  rectangle. For the 40 attempts we tried it got 26 hits. Apparently it is
  harder to recognize a big rectangle as compared to a square as tested in a
  previous test.

  \paragraph{}
  The number \verb_6_ was perfect as well. It has a similar shape as the circle
  from previous tests of course, so this isn't too surprising.
  We did thought about the following thought during this test: with the current
  algorithm it is not possible to also define a gesture for the number \verb_9_
  because it has the exact same shape but in a different orientation.

  \paragraph{}
  The \verb_W_ shape showed the first signs of trouble. To given an idea, it got
  detected 12 times out of 40 tries. The algorithm isn't optimized for this
  shape, apparently.

  We think this has to do with the sharp corners this shape
  has. For each new data point our algorithm compares the current shape to all
  known (defined) gestures. This is done by walking through both the current and
  the defined gestures. Once they start to differentiate too much the option for
  that gesture is dropped. We believe the sharp angles in this character might
  cause the algorithm to think the difference is too big. You aren't able to
  draw it perfectly every time, of course. The logic is a bit more complex than
  this, but this should give a general idea of how it works and what we think is
  causing the dropped detection rates. The algorithm also has some play when
  comparing rotations, maybe the algorithm starts comparing the wrong rotation
  points further into the trace when the scan points start to deviate too much.
  This could result into inconsistent results as well.

  The decision whether a gesture, or rather a trace of rotations, differentiates
  too much is defined by some constants defined in the \verb_config.rs_ file in
  source-code. We did increase the threshold and some other relevant parameters
  a little which did seem to improve the results a bit. We didn't investigate
  further though due to time constraints and reverted the parameters to ensure
  following tests are consistent. It might be interesting for other groups to
  take a look at this.

  \paragraph{}
  The gesture with two circles worked very well too. No further comment on this.

  \paragraph{}
  The word \verb_hi_, of course a very optimistic gesture, didn't work at all.
  Out of 40 attempts only 1 got recognized correctly. The algorithm is at fault
  for sure, because the figure did show up correctly in the 2D web visualizer.

  One might argue that you shouldn't expect too complex gestures to be
  recognized correctly, especially not for a first iteration of the project. But
  we thought we had to try it anyway.

  \subsection{Conclusion}
  These results means that our gesture recognition can definitely be improved.
  We need to improve the gesture recognition in order to implement even more
  complex gestures. This would all be software improvements, so no new hardware
  is required for now.

  Some properties of the current gesture recognition can be altered in the
  \textit{config.rs} file as mentioned. By including a larger amount of points
  in a match group/scope, failure to recognize a gesture will be lower.
  This is because there will be more points, and more room for deviation from
  the predefined gesture. Following this approach would allow more false positives though.

  \clearpage

  \section{Gesture variety}
  For building a proper gesture based system, we think it is important to
  support as many gestures as possible. The current predefined set is of course
  lacking. If you're binding gestures to actions on
  a computer, you probably want to do as much different things as possible with
  a little difficult gestures as possible. We'll now attempt to define what
  variety of gestures is possible with our current implementation.

  \paragraph{}
  The platform currently has support for tracking gestures based on movements
  with the tip of the index finger. This already limits the number of gesture
  possibilities quite severely. You basically need to use your finger as a pen
  or wand to literally draw a shape.

  In addition, recorded sensor data is currently being processed into a 2D
  representation. This means that it is currently not possible to define 3D
  aware gestures.

  \paragraph{}
  As shown in the previous experiment, large gestures or gestures with sharp
  corners don't work to well yet with the current algorithm without tweaks.

  \subsection{Supported}
  When only defining basic gestures, we could think of the following gesture
  types:

  \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item Circle
    \item Line
    \item Square
    \item Rectangle, in various shapes
    \item Triangle
    \item Simple/distinct numbers: 2, 3, 6, 7
    \item Simple/distinct letters: C, D, J\dots
    \item \dots
  \end{itemize}

  Each figure can have some variations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item Various figure scales, larger and smaller variants
    \item Use both clockwise and counter-clockwise variants
    \item Scale in one dimension, use an oval instead of a circle
  \end{itemize}

  The list is limited, and some variations might collide resulting in false
  positives. Implementing 10 different gestures is however easily doable, as the
  built-in list of gestures does confirm. The question of whether the variety is
  good enough highly depends on the use case for the product.
  % TODO: should have a better story here

  \subsection{Computer control}
  Now, the initial goal of the platform was to develop a platform that would be
  able to fully control a computer using only gestures. We currently don't think
  that that is possible, let alone viable.
  Yes, scrolling up and down by drawing circles left or right would be awesome.
  But these gestures don't cover simple tasks like moving the mouse around.
  It shouldn't be too hard to implement mouse movement based on the location of
  a hand in 3D space, but this falls out of the scope of this project for now.

  \paragraph{}
  There are some problems that would have to be resolved in order for the
  platform to become viable as a computer controlling solution. We've formulated
  a list:

  \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item Only simple gestures get recognized very well, limiting the number of
      usable and reliable gestures
    \item With a system that is purely gesture based, you'd need to have a lot
      of different gestures to make it usable so you don't have to go through
      menus of actions
    \item Gestures do not support multiple fingers, yet
    \item New recorded gestures could be jittery, resulting in a low recognition
      rate
    \item Execution of computer actions would probably slower than using a
      keyboard and mouse
    \item The current implementation is hard to set-up
  \end{itemize}

  We know that resolving these issues is a lot to ask for, but if we would be
  able to solve these problems we could have built a revolutionary new platform.

  \subsection{Improve}
  To improve the results of this test, we believe that additional features need
  to be developed in the platform which does take some time. Think of supporting
  gestures consisting of multiple fingers or even hands, or supporting 3D
  gestures. If multiple fingers are combined in gestures, then it could mean a
  plethora of new possibilities. Improvements would mostly consist of software
  improvements rather than needing to have improved hardware. Think of changes
  in the algorithm and processing logic to allow more advanced figures. We'll go
  over ideas for improvement in the \emph{Ideas} section, the last section in
  this document.

  \subsection{Simple applications}
  So, we don't think it is viable for computer control. There might be
  applications though with just 4 different simple one-shot actions.
  Yes, for such applications this could be used perfectly well. Drawing circles,
  lines and squares works good enough for sure. Think of scrolling through
  pictures in a sterile environment where touchless interaction is desired.

  \clearpage

  \section{Visual feedback}
  An interesting aspect for using our platform is visual feedback, and what the
  effect of using it is on users using our platform. With visual feedback, a
  user would be able to see on a computer screen how the computer (or rather;
  sensor) recognizes his hand(s) and/or gestures. The general idea for this test
  is that showing visual feedback might improve accuracy, as users could adapt
  the gesture they're performing on what they see the computer recognizes.
  The sensor isn't super accurate all of the time, or users might go outside the
  view of the sensor. The visual feedback would immediately show this.

  \subsection{Visualizers}
  Two visualizers are available. The first one is part of the LeapMotion
  software package, and is a 3D visualizer that can be started from the
  LeapMotion control panel. This visualizer shows a 3D representation of
  recognized hands above the LeapMotion sensor inside the bounding box of the
  sensor. Joints are visible in the hand, although our software only uses the
  position of the index finger tip at this moment.

  The second visualizer is the one we've implemented. It is show on the web
  interface that can be opened after starting the software. This visualizer is
  quite different, not only in aesthetics, but also in what it shows. Our
  visualizer is 2D and shows the data that has been processed by our software.
  The \emph{Manual} explains how we are processing the data, and that we're
  mapping 3D points from the sensor in traces of rotational data. This is what
  is rendered in our visualizer, and is essentially what is used for gesture
  detection. This is therefore \emph{closest to reality}, where \emph{reality}
  consists of user defined gestures in our software and the recognition system.
  If gestures show up correctly in this visualizer, the software should
  recognize them correctly. This same visualizer is used for recording and
  trimming new gestures.

  \subsection{Findings}
  For this test we've tried a lot of different gestures, in a lot of different
  positions. Here are some of our statements on our findings:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Drawing circles isn't a problem. The only thing a visualizer might
      help for is to see whether you're performing the gestures within the
      view of the sensor, and to see whether your hand is properly recognized.
    \item Without visual feedback attempting to draw squares, can easily result
      in drawing rectangles, especially when focussing on the screen instead of
      looking at your hand. Having the 2D web visualizer helps greatly as you
      can see whether you're drawing a square properly.
    \item The 3D visualizer is easier to understand, although the data shown in
      the 2D visualizer is more consistent. This, in the sense that using the 2D
      visualizer to guide you to perfectly draw a gesture works better and
      produces more accurate results than using the 3D visualizer.
    \item Either visualizer is useful to see whether the sensor is
      jittering, causing detection failures.
    \item Properly drawing a gesture with the other hand a gesture was
      recorded with is virtually impossible without a visualizer, except for
      shapes that are really simple.
    \item The 2D web visualizer gives a better sense of how big a user is
      drawing a gesture. Allowing the user to be more accurate.
    \item The 2D web visualizer is useful to figure out why a false positive may
      have been detected as it clearly shows the shape that is used for
      recognition.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Conclusion}
  Based on these statements we can conclude that using a visualizer is a good
  idea, as it does seem to improve results for most gestures. There are gestures
  however that don't really benefit from using a visualizer. Such gestures can
  be used in a situation where a visualizer isn't preferred as it would use up
  screen real estate.

  The accuracy of a user drawing a gesture correctly might improve the more the
  user uses the system. We haven't tested this.

  \paragraph{}
  None of the visualizers notify the user if a drawn gesture is similar to a
  user defined gesture (but is not a match). Imagine that you're drawing a
  circle, but too large for it to be detected. The visualizers don't show that
  your circle is too large. This might be something to improve on.

  \paragraph{}
  Note that we, the developers of the platform, have conducted this test. Other
  users that don't understand the internals of the system might experience this
  different. The second visualizer in the web interface shows processed data,
  this might look weird and unintuitive for other users.

  \clearpage

  \section{Detection speed}
  Another important aspect of the gesture recognition system is the speed, or
  rather, the delay for detecting a performed gesture. To avoid confusion, we've
  decided to define the term delay as follows: \textit{The time it takes for the
    platform to show the name of the correct gesture in the console, after a
    gesture has been completely performed above the sensor}.

  \subsection{Counting frames}
  Since it can be tricky to accurately measure the time difference between an
  invocation and an action, we've decided to record 20 invocations.
  With the resulting footage, we'll be able to count delay in
  frames, with precision accurately enough for our use case. The gesture that we
  choose was the square, as is has quite distinctive corners.

  \subsection{Results}
  After performing the our own tests it was quite clear that delay varies
  greatly. The \emph{delay} varied from about 5 to 11 frames. With a speed of 60
  frames per second, each frame is about 17 milliseconds. This defines a delay
  varying between 85 to 187 milliseconds. There were two outliers with a delay
  of 16 to 22 frames which translate to about 270 and 370 milliseconds.

  We believe the varying difference has to do with the accuracy of detecting the
  gesture itself. Imagine you are drawing a perfect square gesture (perfect
  relative to the square gesture you might have previously recorded) above the
  sensor, the gesture will be recognized quicker before even fully completing
  the gesture, as compared to a square motion that differs slightly. Because
  it's virtually impossible to perform the gesture in exactly the same way every
  iteration, a difference in detection is indeed expected.

  Note that our method of testing latency is still quite simplistic. It doesn't
  take computer and screen delay into account. Nor does it test what the latency
  of the used sensor itself is. Our test strictly focusses on the delay between
  performing the gesture and seeing visual feedback. We performed the test with
  the visualizer enabled, which was visible on the material we recorded. What's
  interesting is that it looks like the gesture is instantly (meaning; within
  the same frame) recognized as the last sampled point of a gesture shows up on
  the visualizer. This would suggest that the actual latency for detection on
  the processed data is faster than 17 milliseconds. This is of course not very
  scientific, but we feel it's an awesome result non the less.

  What is important though, is how responsive the detection feels. During these
  tests, the detection (strictly speaking about detection speed) felt snappy
  even during the case of those outliers. The cool thing is that after you've
  performed a gesture you don't have to wait for a detection notification before
  the next gesture can be performed, that helps quite a lot for it to feel
  responsive to our opinion when when repeatedly experimenting with the sensor.

  The platform doesn't support binding
  generic actions to gestures to control a computer yet. And until that is
  tested, it's hard to say whether we'd feel the same when controlling a
  computer with these gestures. We mention this idea of binding actions later in
  this report in the \emph{Ideas} section.

  \clearpage

  \section{Ideas}
  During the project, and during the experiments we've conducted we came up with
  quite a few ideas. Some of them are things we'd wanted to implement but didn't
  have the time for it due to time constraints. Other ideas originate from
  test results we've collected.
  Here follow a few of them:

  \subsection{Multiple fingers}
  The current system only has support for gestures consisting of a single trace,
  being the trace drawn by the index finger of a hand. The first logical
  expansion would of course be to support gestures having motions with 5
  fingers. Sadly, due to time constraints, we couldn't implement this. This
  could be a great opportunity to improve the complexity and depth of the
  platform.

  Our guess is that implementing this isn't too hard when using the same
  detection system as our current platform. The implementation might be as easy
  as extending our \verb_Hand_ structure (in code) to contain 5 traces, instead
  of just 1. This might be cool to experiment with for other groups taking a
  look at this project.

  \subsubsection{Not just finger tips}
  With the extension described above, the system would still only be tracking
  finger tips. The sensor we're currently using is able to report the position
  of all joints in a hand, including the center of each bone and the center of
  the hand palm. This is easily visible in the 3D visualizer that is provided
  with the LeapMotion software package. The \verb_leap-rs_ wrapper that is
  currently used doesn't have an interface to obtain this information yet,
  but this could be implemented without too much effort.

  The same might be true for this implementation, just tracking the trace for
  every joint might be enough. We're of course not sure, that's something cool
  to test out.

  \subsection{3D detection}
  Although we intended to support it at first, 3D gesture detection would be an
  awesome improvement. The current system uses 2D rotational data to represent
  user motions. Simply said; because of processing data to this format, the
  third dimension is lost. We found it difficult to reliably transform a 3D
  curve into 2D rotation data, and wanted to get the 2D system working first.

  Of course, motions in 3D space are transformed into data our platform uses.
  During this process the depth (Z-axis) is lost though. Drawing a circle
  sideways would be detected as moving up and down on a straight line. In this
  system, you might imagine drawing on a virtual plane on the X and Y axis.
  Supporting the Z-axis as well for a 3rd dimension would open up a lot of new
  possibilities for drawing gestures in different orientations and would support
  much more complex gestures.

  \subsection{Bindable actions}
  Our idea was to allow users to bind custom actions to recorded gesture
  templates quite early in the project. This would allow a user to configure the
  platform to control their computer in a generic way. The implementation can be
  as simple as binding mouse (and scroll weel) actions, keys and system
  commands.

  Such an implementation would immediately make the project much more viable for
  use by others (given that it would work properly). This also opens new
  research questions such as; can gestures be complex enough to support enough
  gestures for controlling a generic computer?

  \paragraph{}
  This idea was also the segway to research on how usable a gesture detection
  system is for use in medical \& sterile environments. Imagine doctors not
  having to touch a r√∂ntgen machine to swipe between pictures, by using
  touchless hand gestures instead. The implementation of bindable actions
  should make quite clear whether such a system is usable and reliable.

  \subsection{Multiple sensors}
  An awesome extension would be to use and combine multiple sensors in the
  platform, instead of using a single LeapMotion sensor. The obvious choice
  would be to use a second LeapMotion sensor to combine data of the two. This
  could be used to filter jitter, and to fallback if the view for one sensor os
  occluded.

  This is one of the first things we looked into during the project. Sadly, it
  became apparent that the LeapMotion SDK doesn't support connecting multiple
  sensors, even though the provided library would suggest otherwise as there are
  functions available to obtain a list of connected sensors.
  \href{https://forums.leapmotion.com/t/multiple-leap-motion-support/770}{This}
  forum thread is about this topic, in which users are asking for support to use
  multiple sensors. In this thread, LeapMotion developers have said this is not
  possible.

  \paragraph{}
  It would be fun to use a different computer, or possible a virtual machine
  with a virtual USB controller to support connecting another sensor.
  The data from this sensor would then need to be
  transmitted to the platform to collect the sensor data. This is however
  outside the scope of our project, and is a challenge to properly implement on
  it's own.

  \paragraph{}
  Another option is to implement support for other kinds of sensors, such as the
  XBox Kinect, or something different. Our platform would than need to provide
  the proper abstractions to aggregate the data from different kinds of sensors
  into something the platform could use.

  \clearpage

  \section{Final thoughts}
  With building this platform, and doing these tests we can confirm for sure
  that the software we've developed is able to detect and distinguish user
  defined gestures. The system is dynamic and can be used for recognizing
  figures we would never have thought of.

  \paragraph{}
  Although we didn't reach the goal controlling a computer in a generic manner,
  we do believe we have achieved enough during this project to prove that
  gesture recognition with dynamic gestures is in fact usable.
  The question remains of course, whether
  it's viable to use for computer control. We answered this question with
  no for now, looking at our implementation. Improvements to the system and the
  algorithm we've implemented to greatly improve the possibilities though.

  \paragraph{}
  The platform provides a good basis for further research and is extendable so
  it might open doors for other research purposes. There are more than enough
  things that can be tweaked or improved improved for gesture recognition, more
  complex input and bindable actions. We've mentioned some ideas above. This
  allows other groups interested in this project to experiment further, with
  what is possible and what works. Maybe an implementation can be developed for
  a simple and concrete application where touchless interaction is a useful
  solution.

  \paragraph{}
  We find it unfortunate that we were not able to reach our initial goal,
  because the actual implementation of the gesture recognition system took much
  longer than expected. We had some trouble understanding the true mechanics
  during the project at first, and did walk into some roadblocks on the way.
  We like what we've got so far though, and had fun for sure while implementing
  it. We hope others that might continue this project feel the same and are able
  to built something awesome.
