# Continue work

## TODO
* Fix gesture recording
* Complete developer manual
* Complete experiments

# Requirements

## Requirements assessment
✔️ Build a gesture recognition system  
✔️ Allow to define custom gestures  
✔️ Web interface for configurability  
❌ Control computer with touchless interaction  
❌ Use both hands  
✔️ OS independent  

# Questions

## Questions
* Possible to combine multiple sensors?
* Possible to use multiple fingers?
* Learning curve of touchless control steep?
* Touchless control {easier, faster} vs traditional controls?
* Touchless control sophisticated enough?

## Answers
* No, but visual feedback may decrease the learning time
* For now, no. It is not faster for experienced users anyway
* For now, no. The platform can support all gestures in the future
* No, the SDK is proprietary. Extension is impossible
* Yes, the sensors gives data of all fingers

# Demo

# Thanks!
