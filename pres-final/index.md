# Continue work

## TODO
* Fix gesture recording
* Complete developer manual
* Complete experiments

# Requirements

## Requirements assessment
✔️ Build a gesture recognition system  
✔️ Allow to define custom gestures  
✔️ Web interface for configurability  
❌ Control computer with touchless interaction  
❌ Use both hands  
✔️ OS independent  

# Questions

## Questions
* Possible to combine multiple sensors?
* Possible to use multiple fingers?
* Learning curve of touchless control steep?
* Touchless control {easier, faster} vs traditional controls?
* Touchless control sophisticated enough?

## Multiple sensors
* Possible to combine multiple sensors?

No, the SDK is proprietary. Extension is not possible.
But other sensors can be used.

## Multiple fingers
* Possible to use multiple fingers?

Yes, the sensors gives data of all fingers.
Implementation defines what is possible.

## Learning curve
* Learning curve of touchless control steep?

Unanswered. Visual feedback probably decreases the learning time.

## {easier,faster} / Sophisticated
**Unanswered:**

* Touchless control `{easier,faster}` vs traditional controls?
* Touchless control sophisticated enough?

# Demo
