# Different approach

## Why?
* Too broad
* Little on gestures
* Project in mind
* Why search for a problem?

> * _More effective:_ Research by trying

## How?
* Start with limited research
* Focus on implementation
* Conduct experiments

# Planning

## Everything has changed
* Different week mapping
* First sprint, soon
* Experiment last weeks

# Last week

## Research
* Multiple Leap Motion sensors
* ... and other sensors
* SDK possibilities, alternatives
* Gesture detection libraries

# Achievements & Findings

## Sensors
* 1 Leap Motion / machine
* Other sensors: difficult to abstract

## SDK & Platforms
* Proprietary SDK
* Proprietary sensor data
* Open-source implementation: limited & broken
* Custom game engine implementation, not usable 

## Gesture detection
* No libraries for Rust
* Possible usable C implementation

# Next week

## Continue research
* Gesture based interface viable
* Gesture detection methods

## Start implementing
* First abstractions
* Sensor data fetching
* Basic movement detection
* Initial backend for web configuration

# Thanks!
