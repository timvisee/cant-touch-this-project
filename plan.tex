\maketitle

The Touchless Interface Research minor was supposed to be a project consisting
of three weeks of research, and three weeks of development. However, soon after
the start of the research we discovered that a different approach might be more
suitable for our project. In this paper we explain why the original approach was
not suitable enough, what our new proposal is, and why our proposal suits this
project better.

\subsection*{Original Approach}
As described above, the original approach for the project does not fit well.
This is because of the experimental nature of the project.



\subsection*{New Approach}
In our new approach, we want to spend the rest of this week doing research. This
research will be about the viability of touchless control of a computer.
