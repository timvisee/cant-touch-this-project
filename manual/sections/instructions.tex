  \section{User Instructions}
  This chapter gives users instructions on how to use the \textit{Can't Touch
    This} platform. It assumes that the user has followed the instructions found
  in the \textit{Installation} chapter. The following instructions will detail
  how to setup the platform so that you can conduct the \textit{experiments}
  found later in this manual.
  % Step by step instructions on how to use the research platform to conduct
  % research.
  % Checklist:
  %   •	Instructions to run the experiment (explained in build plan)
  %   •	Aimed at non technical researchers
  %   •	Include screenshots when possible

  % Bonus points: make a video of the instructions, upload to youtube and
  % include link in manual
  % Note: even if video instructions are created the manual should still have
  % written instructions

  % TODO: Write detailed instructions on how to run the experiments
